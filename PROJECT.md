# PROJECT.md — Decisions and why

Companion to BUILD.md. Records what was decided and the reasoning, so nobody re-litigates it later.

## Product

- **It is a gallery, not a compressor with a UI.** People open galleries daily; that's where "Freed X GB" belongs, and the default-gallery role eases write permissions. The optimiser is a feature inside it.
- **Pitch:** everything Google Photos does, on the phone, no cloud — and it pays for itself by freeing space.
- **Priority of value:** video first (~85% of freed space), photos second, screenshots third. Nothing else is worth compressing.

## Access

- SAF folder grants by default; All files access is a later opt-in. Play policy risk and privacy story both favour SAF. Chat media folders are grantable; Downloads is not.

## Quality and reversibility

- Video and photo compression is visually lossless, not lossless. Data is discarded. The app must never say otherwise.
- Reversibility is provided by keeping originals: undo bin, offload to SD/USB, or a delete-after-window. Default is offload when external storage exists, otherwise 30-day window.
- Truly lossless paths (PNG repack, JPEG XL recompress) need no quality gate.
- Skip HDR video, Motion Photos, Ultra HDR, RAW in v1 — the metrics aren't calibrated for them and re-encoding destroys embedded data.

## Speed

- The encoder is not the bottleneck; the quality metric is. So: XPSNR for search (10–20× cheaper than VMAF), VMAF only for verification on sampled windows, and a per-camera predictor table that collapses the search to one probe after ~20 files.
- Decode probe windows once and cache. Pipeline encoder/decoder/CPU in parallel.
- Media3 Transformer instead of hand-written MediaCodec plumbing. Milestone 1 is days, not weeks.

## Battery and thermal

- Charging-only, enforced by the OS (WorkManager constraints), not by app logic. Unplug = job dies.
- Wait for battery full before starting. Pause on thermal headroom, not thermal status, so charging speed isn't hurt and the encoder never throttles.
- Report energy per night from a bench-measured table; live BatteryManager readings are unreliable while charging.

## Files in use

- Originals are only read until the final rename; players keep working through the swap. Background codec priority means foreground apps reclaim the hardware; the worker waits and resumes. Edits during an encode are detected by size/mtime and the job is redone.
- Play-to-compress (tee decoded frames into the encoder in our own player) is the one on-battery path, and only on explicit user action.

## Cleanup features

- Duplicates and chat media review are in. Cache cleaning and Downloads are out: apps cannot clear other apps' caches since Android 11, and cleaner apps making that claim have been removed from Play.

## Gallery features (from what makes existing galleries sticky)

- v1: content search, people & pets, text in photos, trash/favourites/locked folder, basic editing incl. video trim, auto-albums, Motion Photo and Ultra HDR playback.
- v1.1: Memories / On this day, Map view.
- Later: on-device object removal, cast, shared albums.
- All indexing runs on-device in the same night pass as encoding; one index powers search, people, auto-albums, duplicates and memories.

## Codec facts that shaped the spec

- MediaMuxer cannot write fragmented MP4; use standard MP4.
- `BITRATE_MODE_CQ` is not universally supported; search on bitrate.
- HDR encode needs Main10/10-bit surfaces and is patchy; skipped in v1.
- Hardware HEVC is less efficient than x265; expect 30–45% on phone H.264, not 50%.
- Replacing a file with a rename to the same path usually preserves the MediaStore row; reset lastModified and rescan.

## Open questions

- Dependency versions for everything hosted on Google Maven (AGP, androidx, Compose,
  Media3, ML Kit, LiteRT, Accompanist) are unverified: the environment the skeleton was
  written in could not reach `dl.google.com`. They are marked `[google]` in
  `gradle/libs.versions.toml`; `tools/verify-versions.sh` resolves them. Nothing was
  substituted for a STACK.md library — only the version numbers are in doubt.
- Exact XPSNR threshold that maps to VMAF 95 on hardware HEVC — calibrate in milestone 2.
- Whether `MediaTranscodingManager` beats the in-app pipeline on any target device — benchmark in milestone 13.
- Which small face-embedding model to use for people clustering.
